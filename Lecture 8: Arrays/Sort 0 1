Question...)
##Sort 0 1...
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N that contains only integers,
0 and 1. Write a function to sort this array/list. Think of a solution which scans the array/list only once and don't require use of an extra array/list.
Note:
You need to change in the given array/list itself. Hence, no need to return or print anything.

public class Solution {  

    public static void sortZeroesAndOne(int[] arr) {
    	int i = 0;
        int j = arr.length-1;
        
        while(i < j) {
            if(arr[i] == 0) {
                i++;
            }
            else if(arr[j] == 1) {
                j--;
            }
            else {
                arr[i] = 0;
                arr[j] = 1;
                i++;
                j--;
            }
        }
    }
}
