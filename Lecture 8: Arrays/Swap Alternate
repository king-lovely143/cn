Question...)
##Swap Alternate...
You have been given an array/list(ARR) of size N. You need to swap every pair of alternate elements in the array/list.
You don't need to print or return anything, just change in the input array itself.

Solution...)


public class Solution {
    
    public static void swapAlternate(int arr[]) {
    	int i = 0;
        
        while(i < arr.length-1) {
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[i+1];
            arr[i+1] = temp;
            i = i + 2;
        }
    }
}
