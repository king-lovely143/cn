##Fibonacci Number...
Given a number N, figure out if it is a member of fibonacci series or not. Return true if the number is member of fibonacci series else false.
Fibonacci Series is defined by the recurrence
    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1

import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
	
	public static boolean checkMember(int n){
		
        
        
        int a = 0;
        int b = 1;
        int c = 0;
        
        while(a < n) {
            
            c = a + b;
            a = b;
                b = c;
        }
        if(a == n) {
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
