import java.util.*;

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//Scanner is used for user input
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
        //we created sum to store the even sum
        int sum = 0;
        
        int i = 0;
        
        while(i <= n){
            //here we sore the sum of even
            sum = sum +i;
            //then we incriment the i by 2 
            //so that we can always get even number as i is initializes with 0
            i = i + 2;
        }
        //then we print sum
        System.out.println(sum);
	}

}
