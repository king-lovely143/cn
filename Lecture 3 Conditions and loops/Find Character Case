0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z)
-1, if the character is not an alphabet

import java.util.*;
public class Solution {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Scanner is used for user input
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        //here a variable with char c is created to take input from the user 
        
        char c = sc.next().charAt(0);
        // c is used here to check if the char is between of 'A' to 'Z'
        if( c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') {
            //then it will print 1
            System.out.println("1");
            //if c is in the between od 'a' and 'z'
            
        }else if(c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') {
            //then it will print 0
            System.out.println("0");
        }else {
            //if c is not an alphabet it will print -1;
            System.out.println("-1");
        }
    }
}
