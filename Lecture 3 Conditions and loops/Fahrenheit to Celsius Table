##Fahrenheit to Celsius Table...
Given three values - Start Fahrenheit Value (S), End Fahrenheit value (E) and Step Size (W),
 you need to convert all Fahrenheit values from Start to End at the gap of W, into their corresponding Celsius values and print the table.
 
 Solution...
 import java.util.*;

public class Solution {


	public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Scanner is used for user input
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        //as mentioned in the question
        //we take 3 variable to print table
        //start is for starting table
        int start = sc.nextInt();
        //end indicated the ending table
        int end = sc.nextInt();
        //gap make skip between number in the table
        int gap = sc.nextInt();
        //here f is initialized with start
        int f = start;
        //this loop run till end
        while(f <= end) {
            //here we type case the variable to int
            //bcuz we are using floating data type and we need int as output
            //so we type cast the variable
            
            int c = (int)((5.0/9) * (f - 32));
            //this is the formula of conversion of fahrenheit into celsius
            
            System.out.println(f + "\t" + c);
            //then we have some tab space as mentioned in the ques and printed
            //fahrenhiet and celsius
            
            f = f + gap;
            //and we increment the f with gap to maintain the gap
        }
