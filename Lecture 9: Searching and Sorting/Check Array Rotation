Question...)
##Check Array Rotation..
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N.
It has been sorted(in increasing order) and then rotated by some number 'K' in the clockwise direction.
Your task is to write a function that returns the value of 'K', that means, the index from which the array/list has been rotated.

Solution....)

public class Solution {

    public static int arrayRotateCheck(int[] arr){
    	if(arr.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
         int count = arr[0];
        int k = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if(arr[i] < count) {
                count = arr[i];
                k = i;
            }
        }
        return k;
    }

}
