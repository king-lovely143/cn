##Sum of Two Arrays...
Two random integer arrays/lists have been given as ARR1 and ARR2 of size N and M respectively.
Both the arrays/lists contain numbers from 0 to 9(i.e. single digit integer is present at every index).
The idea here is to represent each array/list as an integer in itself of digits N and M.
You need to find the sum of both the input arrays/list treating them as two integers and put the result in another array/list i.e.
output array/list will also contain only single digit at every index.
Note:
The sizes N and M can be different. 

Output array/list(of all 0s) has been provided as a function argument. 
Its size will always be one more than the size of the bigger array/list. Place 0 at the 0th index if there is no carry. 

No need to print the elements of the output array/list.

public class Solution {

    public static void sumOfTwoArrays(int arr1[], int arr2[], int output[]) {
    	int i = arr1.length-1;
        int j = arr2.length-1;
        int k = Math.max(arr1.length, arr2.length);
        int carry = 0;
        
        while(i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
			int sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j] + carry;
            output[k] = sum % 10;
            carry = sum / 10;
            i--;
            j--;
            k--;
        }
        while(i >= 0) {
            int sum = arr1[i] + carry;
             output[k] = sum % 10;
             carry = sum/10;
            i--;
            k--;
        }
        while(j >= 0) {
            int sum = arr2[j] + carry;
            output[k] = sum % 10;
            carry = sum / 10;
            j--;
            k--;
        }
        output[0] = carry;
    }

}
