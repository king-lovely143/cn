Question...)
##Push Zeros to end..
You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N. 
You have been required to push all the zeros that are present in the array/list to the end of it.
Also, make sure to maintain the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note:
Change in the input array/list itself. You don't need to return or print the elements.

You need to do this in one scan of array only. Don't use extra space.

public class Solution {  

    public static void pushZerosAtEnd(int[] arr) {
    	
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if(arr[i] != 0) {
                arr[count] = arr[i];
                count++;
            }
        }
        for(int i = count; i < arr.length; i++) {
            arr[i] = 0;
        }
    }

}
